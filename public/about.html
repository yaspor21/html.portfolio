<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a passionate junior web developer eager to break into the programming world and build dynamic, user-friendly 
  web applications. My journey into technology is built on a strong foundation in business and customer service. I hold 
  a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and have developed invaluable skills from my experiences in retail and hospitality, 
  including roles at Delta Airlines and JetBlue, where I learned the importance of delivering high-quality service and 
  working efficiently under pressure.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m applying my leadership skills as an Assistant Store Manager at Family Dollar while pursuing an MBA in 
  Operational Management. This combination of business acumen and technical training empowers me to approach software 
  development with a unique perspective on efficiency, user experience, and problem-solving.

  <p>When it comes to web development, I’ve invested my time in mastering core skills through the Complete 2024 Web Development 
    Course on Udemy, where I’ve built a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design, among other key 
    technologies. I’ve also created several projects that demonstrate my growing expertise, which you can explore through the 
    links provided on this page.</p>

<p>I’m excited about the future and committed to continuous learning, collaboration, and making meaningful contributions to 
  innovative development teams.

  Thank you for visiting my portfolio—I look forward to connecting and sharing more of my work with you!</p>
